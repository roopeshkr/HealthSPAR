In today's fast-paced world, access to healthcare services is of paramount importance. However, booking appointments with healthcare providers can often be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Patients face challenges such as long waiting times on calls, difficulty finding available appointments, and managing their healthcare schedules. To address these issues, we propose the development of a comprehensive Hospital Appointment Booking System. 
The healthcare sector is witnessing significant advancements in technology. Yet, the process of scheduling appointments remains outdated in many cases. Patients often resort to long phone calls, paper-based records, or multiple visits to hospitals or clinics to secure appointments

The primary objective of the Hospital Appointment Booking System is to streamline and modernize the appointment booking process, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.
